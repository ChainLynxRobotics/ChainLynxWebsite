In 2019, the ChainLynx team was formed with the goal of encouraging students' development of STEM and leadership skills. This is done through participating in a worldwide robotics competition hosted by the organization FIRSTÂ® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology).

To do so requires using computer aided design, coding, fundraising and outreach, as well as actually building the robot. This is a large task that requires months of work, but rewards members with experience in STEM, confidence, and access to a wonderful community.
