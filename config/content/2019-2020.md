Our founding year, we created the basics of our club structure. Full of students new to robotics, we were passionate about learning the basics. During this year we created the basis of our club structure, our first robot, and competed in our first competition.

Our team’s first ever robot was the ‘AT-AT’ (a table - a table). This robot heavily incorporates the use of wood in its design. While uncommon, this allowed us to utilize resources we already had access to so we could focus our attention on more pressing matters such as learning how to code and use power tools. We also had generous support of materials and teaching from Viking Robotics and the Iron Riders.
