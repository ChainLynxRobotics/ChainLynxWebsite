Our club is divided into two groups: Officers and Leads. The Officers are in charge of how the team operates and functions. The Leads on the other hand, manage the different sub teams (specialized divisions of the team) within ChainLynx and do more work with the actual robot itself. A person can hold both an Officer and Lead position with a few exceptions. A person may also be a part of multiple sub teams.

# Sub Teams:
There are sub-team leads for all teams except the drive team.

### Mechanical team:
This team sketches, prototypes, and CADs to develop a design for the robot based on our strategy for the season. Once a final CAD design is made, they use it as a guide for building the robot.

### Code team:
As in the name, the code team creates the code for the robot. Our school offers a variety of computer and coding classes so this team can vary quite a bit in skill level. We currently use Java and our github (where we store our code) can be found at: ChainLynxRobotics · GitHub.

### Business team:
Running a robotics team takes a surprising amount of money with participation 5,000 necessary a year just to participate in competitions! As such, our business team must hold fundraisers and apply for a variety of grants and sponsorships. This team also often engages in advertising.

### Drive team:
This team is at the frontline at competitions - driving the robot! While this sounds like a job that could be accomplished by one person, matches are short and often complicated - requiring one person to survey the field and make real time strategy decisions, another to actually drive the robot, and one to two more members to perform maintenance and game specific actions (giving a game piece to the robot - ect).

### Strategy team:
This team works with the Drive team to figure out what their actions should be for the upcoming matches by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and teammates.

### Scouting team:
Similar to the strategy team, the scouting team also analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of other teams; however, this is for the purpose of deciding which teams we wish to ally with.

### Officers:
Anyone who holds the President or Vice President position cannot hold any others - lead or officer.

### President:
This person works with the team to conduct meetings and acts as the main line of communication between the team and head mentor. In addition to this, they help coordinate the election process (but don’t count/interact with the votes) and represent the club.

### Vice President:
This officer assists the President in their duties and will take on their duties if the President cannot perform them for any reason.

### Assistant officer:
The person in this role fills other roles in case of an absence or unoccupied position.

### Safety Officer:
The Safety officer makes sure that proper procedure is followed when working in the Fabrication lab (when we’re actually building the robot).

### Archivist:
With team meetings often having a week in between each one, the details of the last one can often be forgotten. To prevent this from becoming a problem, the archivist takes notes on decisions made during a meeting as well as attendance.

### Treasurer:
While both the Treasurer and the Business lead deal with the club’s finances, the treasurer focuses more on the recording of outgoing and incoming money, and makes sure that all proper school documents concerning this are submitted.

### Event Coordinator:
This officer alerts the team to any meetings in the coming day(s) through slack and coordinates club meetings and get-togethers.

### Communications Officer:
The Communications Officer represents the team, and puts out information on social media platforms and other forms of communication.
