Commits to the main branch will automatically deploy. Be sure to make changes on another branch and then pull request to the main for changes to go live.

## Running the Dev Server

Once you have a copy of the code on your local machine, you can run the command below to start a dev server to preview your changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

***Tip:** If you are getting 'module does not exist errors', make sure you have installed all the libraries by running `npm install` in the root directory.*

## Editing Pages

Find different config files in the `/config/` directory and use [yml syntax](https://gist.github.com/xputerax/70a32929bf2603ed65990cc3550902a8) to edit text or other values on a page. Most of the config values that edit text on the page support [markdown syntax](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) as well as html and plain text.

### Dealing with images and files

When a config asks for an image (or a file), you can upload it anywhere in the `/public/` directory, and give it the path relative to that directory. 

Although not required, it is highly recommended to place images in the `/public/imgs/[PAGE_NAME]/` folder and then reference it in the config with `url: "/imgs/[PAGE_NAME]/[IMAGE_NAME.png]"`

For example, if you wanted to upload the image `kickoff.png` to the carousel on the home page, you can upload the file to `/public/imgs/index/kickoff.png` and then reference it in the config like this: 
```yml
# Inside  /config/index.yml

parent:
    name: "Kickoff for the 2023-2024 season!"
    url: "/imgs/index/kickoff.png"
```
Directory tree:
```bash
├───config
│       index.yml # <- The config file you edit
└───public
    └───imgs
        └───index
                kickoff.png # <- The image you upload
```
