We started the season on a high coming off of our most successful season yet. We got our CNC router up in the year and was prepared to be used at the start of the season. Kick off that season was full of excitement because it was our first pick and place game in a long time. We created a unique design with an elevator and four bar with adapted every bot pick up and our first season using swerve. We were moderately successful in our direct events for not going any further. We made a lot of technical and team advancements this year and since then have been preparing for the 2023-2024 season.

In the face of an unprecedented virus - Covid-19 - our school went fully online, and our club with it. Unable to work on a robot, we dedicated this year to outreach, branding, and online competitions held by FIRST® (see: [Game Design](/about#game-design), Innovation challenge).

Our founding year, we created the basics of our club structure. Full of students new to robotics, we were passionate about learning the basics. During this year we created the basis of our club structure, our first robot, and competed in our first competition.

Our team’s first-ever robot was the ‘AT-AT’ (a table - a table). This robot heavily incorporates the use of wood in its design. While uncommon, this allowed us to utilize resources we already had access to so we could focus our attention on more pressing matters such as learning how to code and use power tools. We also had the generous support of materials and teaching from Viking Robotics and the Iron Riders.
