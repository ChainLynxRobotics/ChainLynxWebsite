There are sub-team leads for all teams except the drive team, mechanical department, etc.

## <center>Business & Marketing Department</center>

Running a robotics team takes a surprising amount of money with participation 5,000 necessary a year just to participate in competitions! As such, our business team must hold fundraisers and apply for a variety of grants and sponsorships. This team also often engages in advertising.

## <center>Controls Department</center>

As in the name, the code team creates the code for the robot. Our school offers a variety of computer and coding classes so this team can vary quite a bit in skill level. We currently use Java and our GitHub (where we store our code) can be found at ChainLynxRobotics Â· GitHub..

## <center>Drive Team</center>

This team is at the frontline at competitions - driving the robot! While this sounds like a job that could be accomplished by one person, matches are short and often complicated - requiring one person to survey the field and make real-time strategy decisions, another to drive the robot, and one to two more members to perform maintenance and game-specific actions (giving a game piece to the robot - etc).

## <center>Mechanical Department</center>

This team sketches, prototypes, and CADs to develop a design for the robot based on our strategy for the season. Once a final CAD design is made, they use it as a guide for building the robot.

## <center>Strategy Department</center>

This team works with the Drive team to figure out what their actions should be for the upcoming matches by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of their opponents and teammates.
