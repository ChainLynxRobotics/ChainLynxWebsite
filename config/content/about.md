In 2019, the ChainLynx team was formed to encourage students' development of STEM and leadership skills. This is done through participating in a worldwide robotics competition hosted by the organization FIRSTÂ® (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology).

Doing so requires using computer-aided design, coding, fundraising and outreach, and building the robot. This large task requires months of work but rewards members with experience in STEM, confidence, and access to a wonderful community.
