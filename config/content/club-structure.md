Our club is divided into two groups: Officers and Leads. The Officers are in charge of how the team operates and functions. The Leads, on the other hand, manage the different sub-teams (specialized divisions of the team) within ChainLynx and do more work with the actual robot itself. A person can hold both an Officer and Lead position with a few exceptions. A person may also be a part of multiple sub-teams.
